# High Gain Patch Antenna for LEO Satellite Communications
This paper looks to investigate methods of obtaining high gain and directivity from a multilayer
planar antenna for Low Earth Orbit Satellite communications within the Ku band. Firstly, the
issue of internet connectivity in less developed countries is addressed, so a smaller, easier to
install antenna is proposed for satellite communication in replacement of a parabolic dish.
A simulated 10 dB bandwidth of 500 MHz and directivity up to 13.3 dBi is demonstrated
through the vertically-stacked structure with two parasitic directive layers. In conclusion,
a link budget shows the featured antenna improves link performance when compared to
single-layer patch, and is viable for use in a mobile terminal in place of a parabolic dish.
